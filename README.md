task 1:
we create 8 notebooks for task 1 are as follows:
1. Variable selection and rules of varible seletion.
2. Operaters and it's 7 types. arithmatic, assignment ,logical, comparision, identity, membership, bitwise oprater,ect.are operaters.
 python data type has two types. i.e immutable and mutable . In immutable and mutable there are three types.
   immutable - 1) Numbers 2) String 3) Tuple
   mutable - 1) List 2) set 3) Dictionary
 3. We studied number data type and it's example.
 4. string data type , examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 6. List data type and it's methods with examples of methods.
 7. Set data type and it's methods with various examples.
 8. Dictionary data type and it's methods.

 
 Task 2 :

 In Task 2 we saw some different conditions and loop like if, if else, if elif, for loop, while loop, etc. 
 In these conditions we have seen how their syntax works. And learned when and how to use these condition.
 In that we create 5 notebooks as follows:
 1. In if condition we check results, odd numbers ,even numbers, positive numbers,ect. using if condition.
 2. In if else condition if the previous conditions were not true, then this condition is used. if condition with 20 examples like pass fail , odd even
 3. if elif conditions with 20 examples.
    

 Task 3:-

 i) It was statement regarding. In it we learned what Break, Pass and Continue statement are and how they are used in for loop and while loop. And from the name we can understand that what will be their work. Break is used to break a loop, etc
 ii) After this we learned what statistical user defined function is. A function was created using statistical concept in it. Just created a function using its formula to find the mean.
 iii) Later learned what Logical user defined function is. Using this concept, a function was created after understanding the logic behind any concept or any formula.
