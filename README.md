# Task 1 :
we create 8 notebooks for task 1 are as follows:
1. Variable selection and rules of varible seletion.
2. Operaters and it's 7 types. arithmatic, assignment ,logical, comparision, identity, membership, bitwise oprater,ect.are operaters.
   python data type has two types. i.e immutable and mutable . In immutable and mutable there are three types.
     immutable - 1) Numbers 2) String 3) Tuple
      mutable - 1) List 2) set 3) Dictionary
 3. We studied number data type and it's example.
 4. string data type , examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 6. List data type and it's methods with examples of methods.
 7. Set data type and it's methods with various examples.
 8. Dictionary data type and it's methods.

 
 # Task 2 :

 In Task 2 we saw some different conditions and loop like if, if else, if elif, for loop, while loop, etc. 
 In these conditions we have seen how their syntax works. And learned when and how to use these condition.
 In that we create 5 notebooks as follows:
 1. In if condition we check results, odd numbers ,even numbers, positive numbers,ect. using if condition.
 2. In if else condition if the previous conditions were not true, then this condition is used. if condition with 20 examples
     like pass fail , odd even
 3. if elif conditions with 20 examples.
    

 # Task 3 :

In this task we created 5 notebooks of control statements and user define function.
1. Break statement, use and 5 examples each.
2. Pass statement, syntex ,use and examples.
3. continue statement ,use, syntex and examples.
4. user define functions syntex and examples.
5. Logical user define functions syntex ,examples.

# Task 4 :

1. Numpy library : basic ,random ,( distribution and visualizations), and universal function.

# Task 5 :

In this task we created 5 notebooks of pandas as follows:
1. Pandas introduction, series creation and operations.
2. Dataframe creation using dictionary, matrix , and to read csv and xlsx file.
3. Dataframe operations and examples.
4. Selection in dataframe using row or coloumn selection, delete, update, index, remove index, etc and operations between two dataframes with examples.
5.  Missing values: checking for missing values, dropping missing values and fill missing values.

# Task 6 :

In this task we create 2 nootebooks of matplotlib and seaborn library
1. matplotlib: data visuallization like scatter ,histogram ,pie chart, etc.
2. seaborn: all type of data visuallization and examples.

# Task 7 :

In this task there are three notebooks of exercises.
1. Numpy : exmples of array,matrix array,how to create random numbers from distributions,etc.
2. Different operations on dataset of ecommerce purchases and salary dataset.

# Task 8 :   
In this task we create three notebooks of exercises. In that we done some opration of gven data.
1. NumPy exercise   
2. Ecommarce Purchases   
3. Salaries exercise   

# Case Study :     

In this case study taitanic data set was downloded from kaggle.     

* Data importing :        
  data import by using csv files and import necessary libraries.
* data preprocessing :    
    In that we find missing value ,fill or drop, if need drop variable ,label encoding for categorical variable ,ect
* Visualisation:     
    we plot different plots like bar plot , scatter plot ,joint bar plot, Pie chart, etc.
* Model building:   
    choose dependent and independent variables ,split data into train test ,80:20.
* Model building:     
     In that 3 algorithems are done i.e Naive bays model on train data,  knn algorithm ,decision tree.   
     In that first import algorithms and predict test data using fitted model.   
* Model evaluation:         
   find accuracy ,find classification report, find confusion matrices.      
* Comparison:   
   create dataframe of comparision Accuracy,recall and precision.   

  # Dashboard :    

  On our project data (Customer churn analysis) we created dashboard for more visualization of data.    
  power BI software is used for creating dashboard of customer churn analyze.     

  # Final Project :    

  Final project topic is customer OTT churn analysis.     
  About the project :   
     importing the data from kaggle    
* data preprocessing :    
    In that we find missing value ,fill or drop, if need drop variable ,label encoding for categorical variable ,ect    
* Visualisation:     
    we plot different plots like bar plot , scatter plot ,joint bar plot,Pie chart, etc   
* Model building:    
     Choose dependent and independent variables from data ,split data into train test , 80:20.    
     In that 10 different algorithems are done i.e Logistic , Naive bays model , knn algorithm ,decision tree ,Random forest , ect.     
     In that first import algorithms , fit model and predict test data using fitted model. also find accuracy ,precision , classification report and confusion matrics.   
     GridSearchCV algorithem is also used for model building.     
     Select Feature importance using decision tree and there models.     
* Comparison:     
    GridSearchCV and Basic models.    
    Feature importance and GridSearchCV.     
* Dashboard:
