# Task 1 :
we create 8 notebooks for task 1 are as follows:
1. Variable selection and rules of varible seletion.
2. Operaters and it's 7 types. arithmatic, assignment ,logical, comparision, identity, membership, bitwise oprater,ect.are operaters.
   python data type has two types. i.e immutable and mutable . In immutable and mutable there are three types.
     immutable - 1) Numbers 2) String 3) Tuple
      mutable - 1) List 2) set 3) Dictionary
 3. We studied number data type and it's example.
 4. string data type , examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 5. tuple data type, examples and it's methods.
 6. List data type and it's methods with examples of methods.
 7. Set data type and it's methods with various examples.
 8. Dictionary data type and it's methods.

 
 # Task 2 :

 In Task 2 we saw some different conditions and loop like if, if else, if elif, for loop, while loop, etc. 
 In these conditions we have seen how their syntax works. And learned when and how to use these condition.
 In that we create 5 notebooks as follows:
 1. In if condition we check results, odd numbers ,even numbers, positive numbers,ect. using if condition.
 2. In if else condition if the previous conditions were not true, then this condition is used. if condition with 20 examples
     like pass fail , odd even
 3. if elif conditions with 20 examples.
    

 # Task 3 :

In this task we created 5 notebooks of control statements and user define function.
1. Break statement, use and 5 examples each.
2. Pass statement, syntex ,use and examples.
3. continue statement ,use, syntex and examples.
4. user define functions syntex and examples.
5. Logical user define functions syntex ,examples.

# Task 4 :

1. Numpy library : basic ,random ,( distribution and visualizations), and universal function.

# Task 5 :

In this task we created 5 notebooks of pandas as follows:
1. Pandas introduction, series creation and operations.
2. Dataframe creation using dictionary, matrix , and to read csv and xlsx file.
3. Dataframe operations and examples.
4. Selection in dataframe using row or coloumn selection, delete, update, index, remove index, etc and operations between two dataframes with examples.
5.  Missing values: checking for missing values, dropping missing values and fill missing values.

# Task 6 :
In this task we create 2 nootebooks of matplotlib and seaborn library
1. matplotlib: data visuallization like scatter ,histogram ,pie chart, etc.
2. seaborn: all type of data visuallization and examples.
